abstract = {The existence of unpaired electrons in the four heme groups of deoxy and methemoglobin (metHb) gives these species paramagnetic properties as contrasted to the diamagnetic character of oxyhemoglobin. Based on the measured magnetic moments of hemoglobin and its compounds, and on the relatively high hemoglobin concentration of human erythrocytes, we hypothesized that differential migration of these cells was possible if exposed to a high magnetic field. With the development of a new technology, cell tracking velocimetry, we were able to measure the migration velocity of deoxygenated and metHb-containing erythrocytes, exposed to a mean magnetic field of 1.40 T and a mean gradient of 0.131 T/mm, in a process we call cell magnetophoresis. Our results show a similar magnetophoretic mobility of 3.86 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg for erythrocytes with 100{\%} deoxygenated hemoglobin and 3.66 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg for erythrocytes containing 100{\%} metHb. Oxygenated erythrocytes had a magnetophoretic mobility of from {\"{y}}0.2 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg to 10.30 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg, indicating a significant diamagnetic component relative to the suspension medium, in agreement with previous studies on the hemoglobin magnetic susceptibility. Magnetophoresis may open up an approach to characterize and separate cells for biochemical analysis based on intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties of biological macromolecules.},

abstract = {Over ninety years ago, on November 8, 1845, Michael Faraday in-vestigated the magnetic properties of dried blood and made a note "Must try recent fluid blood." If he had determined the magnetic susceptibilities of arterial and venous blood, he would have found them to differ by a large amount (as much as twenty per cent for completely oxygenated and completely deoxygenated blood); this discovery without doubt would have excited much interest and would have influenced appreciably the course of research on blood and hemoglobin.1 Continuing our investigations of the magnetic properties and structure of hemoglobin and related substances,2 we have found oxyhemoglobin and carbonmonoxyhemoglobin to contain no unpaired electrons, and ferro-hemoglobin (hemoglobin itself) to contain four unpaired electrons per heme. The description of our experiments and the interpretation and discussion of the results are given below. Note on Nomenclature.-The current nomenclature of hemoglobin and related sub-stances was formulated at a time when,precise information about the chemical composi-tion and structure of the substances was not available. Now that some progress has been made in gathering this information, especially in regard to chemical composition, it is possible to revise the nomenclature in such a way as to make the names of substances more descriptive than the older names, without introducing any radical changes. In formulating the following set of names we have profited by the continued advice of Dr. Alfred E. Mirsky. The names whose use we advocate are given below, followed in some cases by ac-ceptable synonyms. The expressions in parentheses are those whose use we consider to be undesirable. Heme: an iron-porphyrin complex (generic term, used for either ferroheme or ferri-heme). Ferroheme (reduced heme): a complex of ferrous iron and a porphyrin. Ferriheme (oxidized heme): a complex of ferric iron and a porphyrin. Ferriheme chloride, hemin: a compound of ferriheme and chloride ion. Ferriheme hydroxide, hematin: a compound of ferriheme and hydroxyl ion. Ferrohemochromogen, hemochromogen: a complex of ferroheme and another sub-stance, or two other substances, having the characteristic hemochromogen spectrum and involving covalent bonds from the iron atom to the porphyrin nitrogen atoms and the attached groups.2 Individual hemochromogens may be designated by specifying the attached groups, as globin hemochromogen (ferroheme and denatured globin), dicyanide hemochromogen, dipyridine hemochromogen, carbonmonoxy-hemochromogen, pyridine carbonmonoxyhemochromogen, etc. 210 PROC. N. A. S. VOL2,16 CHEMISTRY: PA ULING AND COR YELL Ferrihemochromogen (parahematin): a compound of ferriheme and another sub-stance or two other substances, involving covalent bonds from the iron atom to the porphyrin nitrogen atoms and the attached groups.3 Hemoglobin: a conjugated protein containing heme and native globin (generic term, used for both ferrohemoglobin and ferrihemoglobin and also for closely related substances); specifically, ferrohemoglobin. Ferrohemoglobin, hemoglobin (reduced hemoglobin): a conjugated protein formed by combination of ferroheme and native protein. Oxyhemoglobin: a compound of ferrohemoglobin and oxygen. Carbonmonoxyhemoglobin, carbon monoxide hemoglobin (carboxyhemoglobin): a compound of ferrohemoglobin and carbon monoxide. Ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin): a conjugated protein formed by combination of ferriheme and native globin.3 Carbonmonoxyhemoglobin.-The magnetic measurements are described in the experimental part below. The carbonmonoxyhemoglobin molecule is found to have zero magnetic moment, and hence to contain no unpaired electrons. This is to be interpreted as showing that at least two 3d orbitals of each ferrous iron atom are involved in covalent bond formation, the atom presumably forming six octahedral d2sp3 bonds, four to the porphyrin nitrogen atoms, one to an atom (probably nitrogen) of the globin, and one to the carbon monoxide molecule:},

abstract = {Two articles published by Pauling and Coryell in PNAS nearly 80 years ago described in detail the magnetic properties of oxy-and deoxyhemoglobin, as well as those of closely related compounds containing hemes. Their measurements revealed a large difference in magnetism between oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of the protein and, along with consideration of the observed diamagnetism of the carbonmonoxy derivative, led to an electronic structural formulation of oxyhemoglobin. The key role of hemoglobin as the main oxygen carrier in mammalian blood had been established earlier, and its allosteric behavior had been described in the 1920s. The Pauling–Coryell articles on hemoglobin represent truly seminal contributions to the field of bioinorganic chemistry because they are the first to make connections between active site electronic structure and the function of a metalloprotein. heme | bioinorganic | magnetism | oxygen transport | metalloproteins Hemoglobin occupies a very special place in the annals of chemistry. Work on the protein began in the early 1800s, when it was found to be a major component of mammalian blood cells and, importantly, found to contain iron. Isolation of hemoglobin was achieved by H{\"{u}}nefeld in 1840 (1); shortly thereafter, it was determined to have four one-iron sub-units, each with a relative molecular mass of 16,000 (an unprecedentedly large value at the time). Research aimed at discovery of other properties of hemoglobin followed almost im-mediately, including observations in 1845 by Michael Faraday that it was not magnetic, in contrast to most other iron-containing matter (2). These measurements were conducted by placement of a sample between the poles of a magnet and measuring its change in weight. Magnetic samples were drawn into the field, giving an increase in weight; nonmagnetic (diamagnetic) materials were repelled by the field, accompanied by a negligible or slight decrease in weight. In this context, remember that it was fully 80 years later that the notion of electron spin would be proposed as the principal basis of magnetic behavior.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In recent years, cognitive neuroscientists have taken great advantage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a non-invasive method of measuring neuronal activity in the human brain. But what exactly does fMRI tell us? We know that its signals arise from changes in local haemodynamics that, in turn, result from alterations in neuronal activity, but exactly how neuronal activity, haemodynamics and fMRI signals are related is unclear. It has been assumed that the fMRI signal is proportional to the local average neuronal activity, but many factors can influence the relationship between the two. A clearer understanding of how neuronal activity influences the fMRI signal is needed if we are correctly to interpret functional imaging data.},
