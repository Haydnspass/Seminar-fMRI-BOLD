abstract = {With the extreme dimensionality of functional neuroimaging data comes extreme risk for false positives. Across the 130,000 voxels in a typical fMRI volume the probability of at least one false positive is almost certain. Proper correction for multiple comparisons should be completed during the analysis of these datasets, but is often ignored by investigators. To highlight the danger of this practice we completed an fMRI scanning session with a post-mortem Atlantic Salmon as the subject. The salmon was shown the same social perspective-taking task that was later administered to a group of human subjects. Statistics that were uncorrected for multiple comparisons showed active voxel clusters in the salmon's brain cavity and spinal column. Statistics controlling for the family-wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) both indicated that no active voxels were present, even at relaxed statistical thresholds. We argue that relying on standard statistical thresholds (p {\textless} 0.001) and low minimum cluster sizes (k {\textgreater} 8) is an ineffective control for multiple comparisons. We further argue that the vast majority of fMRI studies should be utilizing proper multiple comparisons correction as standard practice when thresholding their data.},

abstract = {One of the limitations of anatomy-based imaging approaches is its relative inability to identify whether specific brain functions may be compromised by the location of brain lesions or contemplated brain surgeries. Of the many techniques available to the surgeon, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the primary modality of choice because of the ability of MRI to serve as a " one-stop shop" for assessing both anatomy and functionality of the brain. This article discusses the specific requirements for establishing an fMRI program, including specific software and hardware requirements. In addition, the nature of the fMRI CPT codes is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Echo-planar imaging is a fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique that allows acquisition of single images in as little as 20 msec and performance of multiple-image studies in as little as 20 seconds. Echo-planar imaging achieves its speed by obtaining all spatial-encoding information after a single radio-frequency (RF) excitation. Conventional imaging requires multiple-RF excitations, separated by the repetition time (TR), to acquire this information. An "infinite" TR, routine lipid suppression, and sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility are other features of echo-planar imaging. Standard pulse sequences are used to obtain echo-planar images, which have diagnostic utility similar to that of conventional MR images. Echo-planar imaging is less sensitive to motion than is conventional MR imaging and allows imaging of rapidly changing physiologic processes such as blood flow and kinetic activity. Echo-planar imaging is opening new areas of MR imaging research and clinical applications.},

abstract = {The existence of unpaired electrons in the four heme groups of deoxy and methemoglobin (metHb) gives these species paramagnetic properties as contrasted to the diamagnetic character of oxyhemoglobin. Based on the measured magnetic moments of hemoglobin and its compounds, and on the relatively high hemoglobin concentration of human erythrocytes, we hypothesized that differential migration of these cells was possible if exposed to a high magnetic field. With the development of a new technology, cell tracking velocimetry, we were able to measure the migration velocity of deoxygenated and metHb-containing erythrocytes, exposed to a mean magnetic field of 1.40 T and a mean gradient of 0.131 T/mm, in a process we call cell magnetophoresis. Our results show a similar magnetophoretic mobility of 3.86 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg for erythrocytes with 100{\%} deoxygenated hemoglobin and 3.66 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg for erythrocytes containing 100{\%} metHb. Oxygenated erythrocytes had a magnetophoretic mobility of from {\"{y}}0.2 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg to 10.30 3 10 {\"{y}}6 mm 3 s/kg, indicating a significant diamagnetic component relative to the suspension medium, in agreement with previous studies on the hemoglobin magnetic susceptibility. Magnetophoresis may open up an approach to characterize and separate cells for biochemical analysis based on intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties of biological macromolecules.},

abstract = {Two articles published by Pauling and Coryell in PNAS nearly 80 years ago described in detail the magnetic properties of oxy-and deoxyhemoglobin, as well as those of closely related compounds containing hemes. Their measurements revealed a large difference in magnetism between oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of the protein and, along with consideration of the observed diamagnetism of the carbonmonoxy derivative, led to an electronic structural formulation of oxyhemoglobin. The key role of hemoglobin as the main oxygen carrier in mammalian blood had been established earlier, and its allosteric behavior had been described in the 1920s. The Pauling–Coryell articles on hemoglobin represent truly seminal contributions to the field of bioinorganic chemistry because they are the first to make connections between active site electronic structure and the function of a metalloprotein. heme | bioinorganic | magnetism | oxygen transport | metalloproteins Hemoglobin occupies a very special place in the annals of chemistry. Work on the protein began in the early 1800s, when it was found to be a major component of mammalian blood cells and, importantly, found to contain iron. Isolation of hemoglobin was achieved by H{\"{u}}nefeld in 1840 (1); shortly thereafter, it was determined to have four one-iron sub-units, each with a relative molecular mass of 16,000 (an unprecedentedly large value at the time). Research aimed at discovery of other properties of hemoglobin followed almost im-mediately, including observations in 1845 by Michael Faraday that it was not magnetic, in contrast to most other iron-containing matter (2). These measurements were conducted by placement of a sample between the poles of a magnet and measuring its change in weight. Magnetic samples were drawn into the field, giving an increase in weight; nonmagnetic (diamagnetic) materials were repelled by the field, accompanied by a negligible or slight decrease in weight. In this context, remember that it was fully 80 years later that the notion of electron spin would be proposed as the principal basis of magnetic behavior.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We know that its signals arise from changes in local haemodynamics that, in turn, result from alterations in neuronal activity, but exactly how neuronal activity, haemodynamics and fMRI signals are related is unclear. It has been assumed that the fMRI signal is proportional to the local average neuronal activity, but many factors can influence the relationship between the two. A clearer understanding of how neuronal activity influences the fMRI signal is needed if we are correctly to interpret functional imaging data.},
