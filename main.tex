\section{Physiology}
Not only is the knowledge of the functional structure of the human brain a major issue for neuroscientists, it's vast complexity is also fascinating for almost everyone.
Major parts of the brain consists of neurons. 
Biophysical aspects are understood on a neuron-wise context, membrane potentials, ion channels and signal propagation are topics to be found in all physiology books which are worth the paper they have been printed on.\cite[577 et. seq.]{guyton}

Being aware that a physical description is possible on a microscopic scale, it is a task of huge complexity to describe neural activity in total.
Direct measurement of neural activity, i.e. placing eletrodes directly in the brain, requires surgery and most of the time this can only be done in animal experiments. 
Information can be received at the scalp of the brain, however this is a rather rough estimation and not useful for drawing precise activation maps.\cite[6]{buxton}
Modern approaches are positron emission tomography (PET) or funtional magnetic resonance imaging among others.
These methods rely on a implicit measurement, as no electrical field or voltage drop is measured, but other quantities which are followup-like, namely glucose consumption or blood oxygenation level, which are again measured implicitly.
In the former case, tracers with glucose accumulate in regions of high glucose consumption resulting in a local higher active radiation source.
In the latter case, blood oxygenation level changes local inhomogenities of the magnetic field and leads to different \textit{$T_2^*$} relaxation.
The author wants to focus on aspects of the latter one and shortly describe important underlying principles as well as the most basic but necessary physiological knowledge.
With ongoing progress in medical physics research promising measurement method \textit{Magnetoencephalography (MEG)} with great spatial and temporal resolution is mentioned briefly in \autoref{sec:outlook}. 

\subsection{Neural Activity}


Notes:
Deoxy is paramagnetic, induces magnetic field inhomogenity \\
Oxy is diamagnetic, no influence \\
Cerebal blood flow. Brain activity -. blood flow -. oxygenated hemoglobin -. $T_2^*$ -. MRI signal\change{Only thoughts}

\subsection{Magnetic Properties}
\label{sub:magneticProperties}
The magnetic properties of hemoglobin and it's related substances were described by Pauling and Coryell in 1936.\cite{pauling}\improvement{Add information to pauling, journal etc.}
Deoxygenated hemoglobin is paramagnetic since the iron atom is ionically bound and four unpaired electrons are present per hemoglobin-group. 
As shown in \autoref{fig:bindingHb}, oxygenated hemoglobin we see a covalent iron binding structure and no unpaired electrons, therefore oxygenated hemoglobin behaves diamagnetic.\cite{Zborowski}

  \label{fig:bindingHb}
\end{figure}
XXX\improvement{Ask Max which is what.}
This is the very difference which leads to a deviation in the measured signal between deoygenated hemoglobin and oxygenated hemoglobin.
A paramagnet leads to a stronger distortion of the local magnetic field than a diamagnetic behaviour, therefor a signal decrease because of stronger $T_2^*$ decay due to faster dephasing.
measured as image contrast by the MRI machine. As shown in figure \change{Add sequence / relaxation figure or reference it.}

\section{Sequence and Signal}
\label{sec:sequenceSignal}

The usefulness of a neuronal activity map does come with not only spatial but also temporal resolution.
Therefore parameterspace is limited to this constraint.\change{does not sound good}
One also needs to limit parameters further, according to \autoref{sub:magneticProperties}. 
We want to \textit{$T_2^*$ - weight} the image and account for local inhomogenities one eliminates on purpose using Spin-Echo sequence.\improvement{wording}
Incorporating the requirements raised above (introduction \autoref{sec:sequenceSignal}) the author wants to draw the line from SE to EPI sequence.\improvement{Sounds strange.}

Citationstyle\unsure{Unsure citation style.}\change{Citation GRE dummy}
Going back to the very basic Spin Echo sequence (by Erwin Hahn \cite{hahn}) one uses a time excessiv 180 degree pulse to refocus magnetic moments and eliminate local inhomogenities.
 In this sequence one \textit{line} of constant phase in fourier-space is acquired at a time.
This sequence is time-consuming due to the use of a 180 degree pulse and the serial acquisation of \textit{lines} in 2D fourier space, therefore one can not use this sequence for BOLD contrast. 
Firstly, one wants to account for local inhomogenities (free induction decay, $T_2^*$), secondly the SE is too slow to fullfil the requirement of reasonable temporal resolution.
Gradient- or Fast-Field-Echo (GRE resp. FFE\unsure{look up how to write this}) sequences omit a 180 degree refocussing radio frequency pulse and enforce de- and rephasing with a negative and positive frequency gradient.
This leads to the availability of short repition times.
Since the abscence of a 180 degree rf pulse, there is no compensation for local inhomogenities and the signal decays with $T_2^*$.\cite[52]{weishaupt}

\subsection{Echo Planar Imaging Sequence}
\label{sub:epi}

With the sequence of intereset, the \textit{echo planar imaging sequence}, even shorter acquisition times are available.
It is a \textit{one step further} GRE-sequence and condenses the acquisition of a complete 2D image within a single excitation as shown in \autoref{subfig:epi}.
\begin{figure}[hb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = .5\textwidth]{pictures/kSpaceEpi.png}
  \caption{EPI sequence in 2D k-space. Blipped phase gradient is shown here (rectilinear curvature).}
  \label{fig:kEpi}
\end{figure}
After an initial slice-selective $\alpha$-pulse\footnote{Note that one is not fixed to 90degree angle as initial excitation and often uses different angles as a tradeoff between excitation amplitude and T1 relaxation possibility. This can be in principal used for many image sequences but is integral part in others (e.g. GRE sequence in \autoref{subfig:gre}).} a strong negative phase gradient is applied and the frequency gradient switches polarity very rapidly.
As with the GRE sequence, de- and rephasing is induced with this former frequency gradient. 
In contrast to GRE, phase direction is read during a single or very few excitations (single shot EPI, multi-shot EPI respectively) which can be done by the small intermediate \textit{blibs} of the phase gradient, resulting in the rectilinear curvature as shown in \autoref{fig:kEpi}.
This is known as the \textit{blipped EPI} sequence, a development coming from an earlier \textit{non-blipped EPI} which used a constant phase gradient resulting in a global zick-zack structure.\cite[1048]{delapaz}\\
Conventionally, imaging time is
\begin{equation}
  T_{tot} = NEX \cdot TR \cdot NPS,
\end{equation}
where NEX is the number of excitations per step, TR repition time and NPS is the number of phase encoding steps.
A typical $T_1$ weighted image with $TR = 500ms$ and 128 phase-encoding steps would require approximately $1min$ imaging time, a $T_2$ weighted image with $TR = 3000ms$ approximately $6min$.\cite[92]{buxton}
This would clearly contradict the requirement of reasonable temporal resolution, since physiological effects would smear out over this amount of time.
With adjusted TR, GRE achieves orders of magnitude less acquisition times ($<1s$), condensing the phase encoding steps in one excitation (single-shot) \enquote{acquisition of single images in as little as 20 msec [...]}\cite[1045]{delapaz} are possible.
